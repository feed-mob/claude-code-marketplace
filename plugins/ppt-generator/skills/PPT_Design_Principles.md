# PPT Design Principles

## 🎯 1. Content Structure

1.  **Logical Flow**
    -   Follow a "Overview → Details → Summary" pattern.
    -   One main idea per slide.
    -   Use clear, guiding titles like "Current Challenges,"
        "Solutions," or "Results."
2.  **Keep It Concise**
    -   Use keywords instead of full sentences.
    -   Apply the 6x6 rule: no more than 6 lines per slide, 6 words per
        line.
    -   Highlight key points with bold, color, or icons.
3.  **Smooth Transitions**
    -   Ensure logical continuity between slides.
    -   Use connectors like "Therefore," "Next," or "As a result."

## 🎨 2. Visual Design

1.  **Consistency**
    -   Keep fonts, colors, icons, and backgrounds consistent.
    -   Use master slides or templates to maintain alignment.
2.  **Color Harmony**
    -   Apply the 60--30--10 rule (main color -- secondary -- accent).
    -   Choose colors based on meaning: blue for trust, red for warning,
        green for success.
    -   Ensure strong contrast for readability.
3.  **Typography**
    -   Title ≥ 28pt, body text ≥ 18pt.
    -   Prefer sans-serif fonts like Arial or Source Sans.
4.  **Visuals & Charts**
    -   Replace text with visuals when possible.
    -   Simplify charts to show key trends and comparisons.
    -   Use high-resolution, undistorted images.

## 💡 3. Presentation Principles

1.  **Audience-Centered**
    -   Adapt tone and content to your audience (executives, clients,
        peers).
    -   Focus on their needs, not just your data.
2.  **Speaker-Led Delivery**
    -   The PPT supports your talk---it's not your script.
    -   Keep slides minimal and elaborate verbally.
3.  **Animations & Transitions**
    -   Use subtle animations to guide attention.
    -   Avoid flashy or distracting effects.

## 🧩 4. Practical Tips

-   Use **icon libraries** (e.g., Noun Project, Flaticon) for visual
    coherence.
-   Align all elements to a **grid** for balance.
-   Leave **white space** for readability.
-   Rehearse with time control, visual clarity, and flow in mind.
